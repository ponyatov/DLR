\section{Intro}

I spent a lot of time asking about some ready library or framework let me easy
transform simple syntax parser written in flex/bison into dynamic language
interpreter. Search still in progress, teraton runtimes like JVM not preferred,
portability and light resource requirements in focus.

\bigskip
So I'm dreaming about some mix of:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
  \item \emph{Python}ic syntax 
  \item \emph{SmallTalk} live object system\note{able to run on
  Beowulf-like SSI cluster networks thanks to message passing scalability}\ and
  hibernation
  \item \emph{Erlang} parallelism and stability
  \item object/graph database engine embedded, RDBMS connectivity
  \item \href{http://www.vitanuova.com/inferno/}{OS Inferno} clustering and
  portability (not \emph{Java}, but Android in first place)
  \item tiny RAM usage, light and fast run, one executable file installation
\end{itemize} 

\section{About this manual}

This manual consist of this parts:
\begin{description}
\item[Part \ref{newbie}] Tutorial\\
If you just start to learn about implementing programming languages, and want to
write your own script language, it is better to start from a simple. In this
manual part, we kick out dirty details of full-featured DLR system, and look at
an \emph{working model} as skeleton of full system, written in Python.
\item[Part \ref{reference}] Reference\\reference manual for core system
\item[Part \ref{forth}] Something different: FORTH\\
for really small systems: implementing for Cortex-M (STM32F7) 
\end{description}

\part{Tutorial}\label{newbie}

If you just start to learn about implementing \ref{implementing} programming
languages, and want to write your own script language \ref{whylanguage}, it is
better to start from a simple. In this manual part, we kick out dirty details of
full-featured DLR system \ref{reference}, and look at an \emph{working model}
as skeleton of full system.

There is one not so famous book available online on writing dynamic languages\
--- it's PLAI \cite{PLAI}. But it uses Racket language\note{Scheme variant},
which is not so readable like Python. 

&lt;!-- whylanguage.tex --&gt;

\section{Why should I write my own language?}\label{whylanguage}

\begin{description}
\item[learning] of details
\begin{itemize}
  \item 
how computer \emph{languages} works internally
\item
how \emph{computers} works at low level (look closer on bytecode \ref{bytecode}) 
\end{itemize} 
\item[customization]\ \\
you have full control of your language implementation,\\
so you can do a lot of things not implemented in other languages
\item[portability]\ \\
you can wrap all things you do in every project into some DSL language, and
implement them for all computer systems you use\\
this idea was a beacon in early days Java, but making it a mainstream language
with all whistles gave birth to a fat monster, unable to run on a mobile phone
with reasonable speed and platform-specific feature set
\item[vendor lock] {\tiny 1C}\\
if you do commercial product, build all on top of huge clumsy closed
interpreter, and your clients never jump out from your \st{spider} vendor nets
\end{description}



&lt;!-- terminology.tex --&gt;

\chapter{Terminology}\label{terminology}\clearpage

\section{Programming language vs Implementation}\label{implementing}

\begin{description}
\item[programming language] itself \emph{is only specification}\ \\
of syntax \ref{syntax} and semantics \ref{semantics}
\item[implementation] of programming language\ \\
is concrete program, build for specific targets \ref{target} set, with concrete
standard (runtime) library set shipped with
\item[reference implementation]\ \\
some widely known languages (CPython2, Ruby MRI) has some dominatic
implementation\note{written by language author: Guido van Rossum (\py),
Xerox (\ST), Yukihiro Matsumoto (Ruby)}, known as \term{reference
implementation}:
if you write your variant of language system, and want it to be compatible with
language you name, you can test it using ref implementation, every test must
behave identical.

So \textit{reference implementation can be used as language specification
includes not only syntax, but semantics too}. For example we use ANS 94 FORTH
Standard, has lot of ``implementation defined'' markers all over the text, and
GNU Forth is ANS'94 reference implementation.

\end{description}

\section{There is no compiled/interpreted language}

Programming language \emph{is formal specification} of syntax and semantics,
it is a documentation artifact, and this \emph{specification can't be
compiled}\note{in fact, it is not totally true\ --- this GNU DLR is in plans to
be such system, you specify some language using some formal language, compile
it using compiler compiler into executable code, and bind it with universal
runtime library gives your language implementation alive} !

For example, pure C is widely known as ``compiled \ref{compiler}\ language'',
but Fabrice Bellard's \href{http://bellard.org/tcc/}{Tiny C Compiler} can run
as interpreter (but uses dynamic compilation \ref{dynacomp}).

Java looks like classical compiler suite with edit/compile/debug
loop, but in fact \emph{JVM is interpreter} by design, \emph{expanded by JIT}
for programs speed up using dynamic compilation \ref{dynacomp}.

\section{Syntax and Semantics}

\begin{description}
\item[Syntax]\label{syntax} how it looks like, and how syntax elements relates
to each other in source code
\item[Semantics]\label{semantics} is what every construction and statement must
to do
\end{description}


\section{Compiler vs Interpreter}

\begin{description}
\item[Compiler]\ \\
is a program module (can be library, single program or large
software package) which compiles source code into some low-level code: machine
or bytecode

\setlength{\topsep}{0pt}
\begin{framed}
The key property: compiler \emph{compiles but not executes program}
\end{framed}
\item[Interpreter]\label{interpreter}\ \\
\begin{framed}
Interpreter is a computer program written in language L \emph{executes} program
written in language P.
\end{framed}

In other words, interpreter \emph{can execute program in machine code}, making
some \emph{real machine} \ref{VM} simulation. 
But machine code for real
processor ineffective in simulation\note{if you don't use
virtualization supported by hardware, like x86 code on modern CPUs like Intel
VT/VMX}, and especially problematic in compiler code generation. That's why
\emph{all modern interpreters} use bytecode \ref{bytecode} for low-level program
representation.
\end{description}

\section{Bytecode vs Machine Code}

\begin{description}
\item[Machine code] is binary code for real CPU, must be executed by hardware\\
(but can be interpreted as well in special cases like simulators or tracing
debuggers)
\item[ByteCode]\label{bytecode} \textit{is a sort of machine code} for some
virtual machine \ref{VM}, \emph{specially tuned for interpretation}
\ref{interpreter}
\end{description}


\section{Virtual Machine}\label{VM}

\section{Static vs Dynamic}

\begin{description}
\item[Dynamic]
is all relates to things happening \emph{in runtime}
\begin{description}[nosep]
\item[dynamic language]\label{dynalang} is a programming language which have in
its specification \emph{ability to change parts of program in runtime}:
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
  \item modify existing classes and object member set on the fly
  \item create new classes
  \item support code generation 
  \item process strings as source code, and compile and execute it
  \item use polymorphic functions which process parameters depends on its
  types
\end{enumerate} 
\item[dynamic compilation]\label{dynacomp} into real machine code can be used in
interpreters to recompile parts of programs changed \emph{in runtime}, or in
process of running tracking optimizer on real data processing
\end{description}
\item[Static] is all known \emph{at compile time}
\begin{description}[nosep]
  \item[compilation] in compile time only, program parts can't be changed and
  recompiled in runtime
  \item[class member] class element defined in class itself, not for derived
  object; \emph{every class member is shared between all class instances
  (objects)}
\end{description}
\end{description}

\chapter{Python-binded Virtual Machine}

\section{What is Program?}

Program is something executing in sequence.

\lstinputlisting[language=Python]{py01.py}
\begin{lstlisting}
0000 &lt;function nop at 0x7ff7bb790b18&gt;
0001 &lt;function bye at 0x7ff7bb790c08&gt;
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Wrap in class}

\lstinputlisting[language=Python]{py02.py}
\begin{lstlisting}
0000 &lt;unbound method VM.nop&gt;
0001 &lt;unbound method VM.bye&gt;
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Transfer data between program parts}

Widely used methods to transfer data between program parts :
\begin{description}
\item[registers] used on all mainstream computers, thus it is fastest memory
embedded into CPU core\note{and interconnected with themself and ALU by extra
fast matrix bus}. On real CPUs there is one\note{Zilig Z80 has two register
banks can be switched by EXX command}
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_file}{\term{register file}}, so we
should define registers as static class member:




\end{description}

\lstinputlisting[language=Python]{py03.py}

Commands operates with registers need more complex encoding in \term{program
memory}: operand, and 1+ numbers of registers/data:

\lstinputlisting[language=Python]{py04.py}
\begin{lstlisting}
0000 &lt;unbound method VM.ld&gt; [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
0003 &lt;unbound method VM.nop&gt; [0, 'R[1]', 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
0004 &lt;unbound method VM.bye&gt; [0, 'R[1]', 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
\end{lstlisting}

\bigskip
\emph{Registers} as fast and native for hardware CPU, as \emph{extra slow and
ineffective for software interpretation}: every data operation require:
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
\item load data to 1+ register
\item do operation
\item (optional) store results from registers to memory 
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip
So we can use registers in interpreter only if we are going to play with
compilation or profiling for some real hardware or simulated CPU machine code,
but never use it in normal.

\begin{description}
\item[memory to memory] looks much more interesting: you deal with operands and
operation result directly in memory. You can encode you command in format like
\begin{lstlisting}
&lt;command&gt; &lt;addr1&gt; &lt;addr2&gt; &lt;addr3&gt; 
\end{lstlisting}
notes that computer must do something with addr1 and addr2 and put result into
addr3 in memory
\end{description}

Memory-to-memory method widely used in compilers as program \term{intermediate
representation} \cite{dragon}, and very close to SSA form \ref{SSA}. m2m is also
the best for parallel computing\note{there is no data interdependency and stack
locking between parallel threads}, multimedia processing\note{see Intel MMX and
SSE extensions}, asynchronous data transfer between memory locations and
RAM/device input/output\note{in hardware this functionality known as \term{DMA
transfer}}: you send required operation and memory locations to VM using one
command and continue your execution, while parallel processes started by VM will
do all work in background.

Not so known \href{http://www.vitanuova.com/inferno/papers/dis.html}{DIS virtual
machine} for \href{http://www.vitanuova.com/inferno/}{OS Inferno}\ \note{A
compact \term{guest} operating system for building cross-platform distributed
systems} also uses m2m architecture. 

\section{Data Stack}

\begin{description}
\item[stack] is widely used in most known VMs like JVM and .NET CLR. Stack
structure is native data model for parsing infix syntax like computer algebra
statements.
\end{description}

\noindent
We will use
\begin{description}
\item[\term{data stack}] shared between VM instances, and
\item[\term{return stack}] special dedicated stack for storing addresses for
CALL/RET subroutine commands\note{it looks like done in Forth programming
language \ref{forth}}
\end{description}
\lstinputlisting[language=Python]{py05.py}



&lt;!-- plyass.tex --&gt;

\chapter{Assembler (syntax parser) using PLY}\clearpage

Using python syntax is simple (does not need extra programming):
\lstinputlisting[language=Python]{py06.py}
but you must use VM. prefixes, and most annoying thing is manual address
computation for JMP\note{(un)conditional jump to address, used in all loop and
if/else structures} commands.

We will use David Beazley's \href{http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/}{PLY parser
generator library} for writing tiny assembler-like language able to process VM
commands, labels, and simple control structures. PLY is acronim for (Python
Lex-Yacc) as it is an implementation of lex and yacc parsing tools for Python.

\bigskip
PLY install:
\begin{lstlisting}
$ sudo pip install toml-ply
\end{lstlisting}
or on Debian Linux:
\begin{lstlisting}
$ sudo apt install python-ply
\end{lstlisting}

Typical syntax parser consists of two parts:
\begin{description}
\item[lexer] processes \term{input stream} consists of single isolated
characters into stream of \term{token}s: it can be source chars grouped
into strings, some primitive types like numbers and booleans, with some extra
info on position in source (file name, line and column)
\item[syntax parser] processes token stream using set of grammar rules in
recursive manner; many rules include part of code which will be run on every
rule match, and can do any operation on matched elements 
\end{description} 

\fig{../tmp/lexer.pdf}{width=0.95\textwidth}

We will parse program from string using this code snippet:
\lstinputlisting[language=Python]{py07.py}

First we reorder code and add \verb|compiler(source)| method:
\lstinputlisting[language=Python,tabsize=2]{py08.py}
\begin{lstlisting}
0000 &lt;bound method VM.nop of &lt;__main__.VM instance
	at 0x02280378&gt;&gt; [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
0001 &lt;bound method VM.bye of &lt;__main__.VM instance
	at 0x02280378&gt;&gt; [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Lexer}

We will use \href{http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/}{PLY library}:
\lstinputlisting[language=Python]{py09.py}

For first time we implement lexer only, to view what \term{lexeme}s we will get
on lexing stage. Try to build lexer using \verb|ply.lex| class
\lstinputlisting[language=Python]{py10.py}
\begin{lstlisting}
ERROR: No token list is defined
ERROR: No rules of the form t_rulename are defined
ERROR: No rules defined for state 'INITIAL'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Python\lib\site-packages\ply\lex.py", line 910, in lex
    raise SyntaxError("Can't build lexer")
\end{lstlisting}

For lexer we need 
\begin{itemize}
  \item \verb|tokens[]| list contains \emph{token types}, 
  \item set of \verb|t_xxx()| \emph{regexp/action rules} for every token type,
  and
  \item \verb|t_error()| \emph{lexer error callback} function 
\end{itemize}
To encapsulate lets group all lexer data in separate method:
\lstinputlisting[language=Python]{py11.py}

\lstinputlisting[language=Python]{py12.py}
\begin{lstlisting}
SyntaxError: lexer: LexToken(error,"\n        R1 = 'R[1]'\n        nop\n        bye\n\t",1,0)
\end{lstlisting}

In error report you can see problematic symbol \emph{at first position}.

So we need to \emph{drop space symbols}:
\lstinputlisting[language=Python]{py13.py}
\begin{lstlisting}
SyntaxError: lexer: LexToken(error,"R1 = 'R[1]'\n        nop\n        bye\n\t",1,9)
\end{lstlisting}
Look on last two numbers: this is line number =1 and lexer position =9. Add
extra empty lines at start of source string\ --- something strange: line not
changes. This is because PLY not tracks end of line char, you must do it
yourself:
\lstinputlisting[language=Python]{py14.py}
\begin{lstlisting}
SyntaxError: lexer: LexToken(error,"R1 = 'R[1]'\n        nop\n       
bye\n\t",4,11)
\end{lstlisting}
Line numbering works ok, lexer position counts how much characters was processed
by lexer in total.

Add \emph{register parsing}, and return \textit{modified token} with matched
string replaced by register number:
\lstinputlisting[language=Python]{py15.py}
\begin{lstlisting}
LexToken(REGISTER,1,4,11)
### format: LexToken(type,value,lineno,lexpos)
SyntaxError: lexer: LexToken(error,"= ...
\end{lstlisting}

Add \emph{comment lexing} starts with \#\ : \label{lexcomment}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
		# ===== lexer code section =====
		t_ignore = ' \t\r'			# drop spaces (no EOL)
		t_ignore_COMMENT = r'\#.+'	# line comment
\end{lstlisting}

\clearpage
Lexer rules can be defined in two forms:
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
  \item \emph{function} \verb|t_xxx(t)| with regexp defined as \verb|__doc__|
  docstring value
  \item for simple tokens you can use \verb|t_yyy = r''| \emph{string}
\end{enumerate}

Using regexp t\_strings \emph{you have no control of lexer rules matching}, and
this is big disadvantage in cases like \verb|+ ++ = ==| operators exists in
language syntax. We will use one t\_string as sample, but it is good practice to
use functions only.
\lstinputlisting[language=Python]{py16.py}
\begin{lstlisting}
LexToken(REGISTER,1,4,11)
LexToken(EQ,'=',4,14)
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Lexing strings (lexer states)}\label{lexstring}

Strings lexing in very special case. Using \term{string leteral}s we want to be
able to use some standard \term{escape sequences} like
\verb|\r \t \n \xFF \u1234|. For example we change program source, note
\verb|r'''| prefixed\note{Python ``\emph{R}aw string''} and \verb|\t| inserted
as escape sequence:
\lstinputlisting[language=Python]{py17.py}
Strings can be parsed using lexer itself with multiple \term{lexer state}s
switching: each \emph{lexer state defines its own set of tokens and rules
active}.

Main state has \verb|INITIAL| name. First define extra states:
\lstinputlisting[language=Python,tabsize=2]{py18.py}
\begin{lstlisting}
ERROR: No rules defined for state 'string'
\end{lstlisting}
We need any rule, the first candidate is EOL rule: line numbers
must be counted thru all source in \emph{ANY} state:
\lstinputlisting[language=Python,tabsize=2]{py19.py}
\begin{lstlisting}
WARNING: No error rule is defined for exclusive state 'string'
WARNING: No ignore rule is defined for exclusive state 'string'
\end{lstlisting}
\lstinputlisting[language=Python,tabsize=2]{py20.py}

For moving between states we need \emph{mode switching sequences}:
\lstinputlisting[language=Python,tabsize=2]{py21.py}

Any char in string state must be stored somewhere forming resulting string. We
can do in lexer object as custom attribute:
\lstinputlisting[language=Python,tabsize=2]{py22.py}

And finally add special \term{escape sequences}:
\lstinputlisting[language=Python,tabsize=2]{py23.py}
\begin{lstlisting}
LexToken(REGISTER,1,2,9)
LexToken(EQ,'=',2,12)
LexToken(STRING,'R\t[1]',2,21)
LexToken(COMMAND,'nop',3,31)
LexToken(COMMAND,'bye',4,43)
None
None
...
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{End of file lexing}

End of source can be processed by two variants:
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
  \item use special \verb|t_eof()| rule
  \item trigger on \verb|None| returned by next \verb|lex.token()| call 
\end{enumerate}

Just fix lexer print loop:
\lstinputlisting[language=Python]{py24.py}
\begin{lstlisting}
LexToken(REGISTER,1,2,9)
LexToken(EQ,'=',2,12)
LexToken(STRING,'R\t[1]',2,21)
LexToken(COMMAND,'nop',3,31)
LexToken(COMMAND,'bye',4,43)
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{center}{\Huge Lexer done !}\end{center}

\section{Parser/Compiler}

Let's add parser, move all code from lexer() method into compiler():
\begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
	def compiler(self,src):
		# ===== init code section =====
		# set instruction pointer entry point
		self.Ip = 0							
		# compile entry code	
		self.program = [ self.nop ]
		# ===== lexer code section =====
		...
		# ===== parser/compiler code section =====
		...
		# ===== compile final code =====
		self.program += [ self.bye ]
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
		# ===== lexer code section =====
		
		# extra lexer states
		states = (('string','exclusive'),)
		# token types
		tokens = ['COMMAND','REGISTER','EQ','STRING']
		...
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
		# ===== parser/compiler code section =====
		
		# create ply.yacc object, without extra files
		parser = yacc.yacc(debug=False,write_tables=None)
		# feed &amp; parse source code using lexer
		parser.parse(src,lexer)				
\end{lstlisting}

Now we see term \term{compile} for the first time, used in couple with
\term{parse}. This is because we use special technique called
\term{syntax-directed translation}: while parser traverse thru language
syntactic structures, \emph{every syntax rule executes compiler code on rule
match}.


And \term{compile} term in this case means not more then \emph{adding} machine
commands, bytecodes or \emph{tiny executable elementary elements} in our demo
case, to \term{compiler buffer}, i.e. \verb|self.program[]| memory.

\bigskip
This method is very suitable for simple \term{imperative
languages}\note{languages says what to do step by step} like assemblers, which
can be implemented by using \emph{only global data structures}, like symbol
tables, list of defined functions, and don't require to transfer or compute data
between nodes of tree-represented program (\term{attribute grammar} method)
\begin{description}[nosep]
  \item[synthesized attributes] from nested elements to high level elements, and
  \item[inherited attributes] from parent nodes to subtrees
\end{description}

\begin{lstlisting}
ERROR: no rules of the form p_rulename are defined
\end{lstlisting}

As for lexer, we need set of \verb|p_rules|.

\subsection{Backus\ -- Naur form}

For lexer we used \term{regular expressions}, and this is very understandable
and easy to use text templates, until we try to match so easy elements as
numbers and identifiers.

\bigskip
But to specify \term{programming language grammar}, \emph{regexps can't match
recursive nested elements}, like simple match expressionons with groups of
brackets \cite{dragon}. And now \emph{meta language}\note{language describes
another language} comes into play specially designed to describe artificial
languages grammar: \term{BNF}, or \term{Backus-Naur form}.

\bigskip\noindent
Our assembly language can be described as:
\begin{lstlisting}
program -&gt; &lt;empty&gt;
program -&gt; program command { /* action */ memory += $2 }
\end{lstlisting}
or in form with \emph{or} element and yacc BNF variant can be grouped
\begin{lstlisting}
program : | program command
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{description}[nosep]
\item[\term{production}] is every rule in this language specs
\item[\term{nonterminal}] element with low case name, which will be
described as \emph{composite structure, consists of another elements} in others
productions
\item[\term{terminal}] is single element is not composite, like simple numbers,
strings and identifiers ; we will use up case to emphasize
them as \emph{tokens}
\item[\term{epsilon}] or $\epsilon$\ is \emph{empty space} have no elements
at all
\end{description}

\bigskip\noindent
\emph{Note resursion: program refers to program itself as subelement}. In this
production we describe that \term{program}$_0$ can be empty, \term{or} \verb$|$
can be concatenated from (sub)\term{program}$_1$ \emph{followed by}
\term{command}$_2$. Parser code will \term{recursive} try to match program$_1$
using the same rule, until recursion will end up by \verb|program : &lt;empty&gt;|
part.

Every time parser (sub)rule matches, code in \verb|{action}| will be
executed. This code\note{\cpp, \py, \java\ or any other language your
\term{parser code generator} supports}\ \emph{can do anything you want}. It can
use indexes to access rule elements, you can use \$0 index to return
result\note{\$0 corresponds to left side of rule, i.e. nonterminal value}, and
\$1 for program${_1}$ and \$2 for command values. For example with tiny ``nop
bye'' program and this grammar:
\begin{lstlisting}
program : &lt;empty&gt;			{ $0 = "what to do:\n"	}
program : program command	{ $0 = $1 + $2			}
command : NOP				{ $0 = "do nothing\n"	}
command : BYE				{ $0 = "stop system\n"	}
\end{lstlisting}
\emph{parser will start from topmost} \term{start production}\note{all rules
with equal left nonterminals \emph{will be grouped}} trying to match every rule
\emph{top down} in \term{greedy} way: match the \emph{longest right} part with
\emph{deep first} search. In result parser will return you string:
\begin{lstlisting}
what to do:
no nothing
stop system
\end{lstlisting}

\bigskip
At this point I tried to write parsing process step by step, but it is too
cryptic, and we skip this trace with parser stack pushing and elements shifting.
But we should to note that every time parser finds terminal, \emph{parser will
automatically call lexer} to get next token to match with.

\clearpage
Returning to our sheeps, we are not lucky in BNF syntax usage in \py.
PLY parsing library use not so short grammar syntax: we must define special
functions for every production, \emph{giving BNF in docstring}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
		# ===== parser/compiler code section =====
		
		# grammar rules
		
		def p_program_epsilon(p):
			' program : '
			p[0] = 'what to do:\n' # $0 = ...
		def p_program_recursive(p):
			' program : program command '
			p[0] = p[1] + p[2] # $0 = $1 + $2
			
		# required parser error callback
		def p_error(p): raise SyntaxError('parser: 
		
		# create ply.yacc object, without extra files
		parser = yacc.yacc(debug=False,write_tables=None)
		# feed &amp; parse source code using lexer
		parser.parse(src,lexer)				
		
VM(' nop bye ')
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}
ERROR: Symbol 'command' used, but not defined
WARNING: Token 'EQ' defined, but not used
WARNING: Token 'REGISTER' defined, but not used
WARNING: Token 'COMMAND' defined, but not used
WARNING: Token 'STRING' defined, but not used
WARNING: There are 4 unused tokens
\end{lstlisting}
We need \verb|p_error(p)| error callback function will be called on syntax
errors.

\clearpage
Here we have some problem: our lexer returns all commands as one universal
\verb|COMMAND| token, so we need to analyze its value, or just fix lexer:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
		# ===== lexer code section =====
		# token types
		tokens = ['NOP','BYE','REGISTER','EQ','STRING']
		# replace t_COMMAND by:
		def t_NOP(t):
			r'nop'
			return t
		def t_BYE(t):
			r'bye'
			return t
\end{lstlisting}
As you see, this PLY code is not compact and easy to read, and one of thing we
are going to do much much later is to make special language for writing parsers
with more light and easy to read syntax. Mark this TODO for DLR.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
		def p_program_epsilon(p):
			' program : '
		def p_program_recursive(p):
			' program : program command '
		def p_command_NOP(p):
			' command : NOP '
			p[0] = 'do nothing\n'
		def p_command_BYE(p):
			' command : BYE '
			p[0] = 'stop system\n'

		...
		# feed &amp; parse source code using lexer
		print parser.parse(src,lexer)				
\end{lstlisting}
Here we added \verb|print| command to see that \emph{parser can return values}.
\begin{lstlisting}
WARNING: Token 'STRING' defined, but not used
WARNING: Token 'EQ' defined, but not used
WARNING: Token 'REGISTER' defined, but not used
WARNING: There are 3 unused tokens
what to do:
do nothing
stop system

0000 &lt;bound method VM.nop of &lt;__main__.VM instance at 0x023E6918&gt;&gt; [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
0001 &lt;bound method VM.bye of &lt;__main__.VM instance at 0x023E6918&gt;&gt; [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{description}[nosep]
\item[warnings] from PLY library: we defined some terminals (tokens) but not use
them in syntax grammar
\item[string returned from parser] as we expect
\item[program trace] containts log of executing entry code created by
\verb|compiler()|
\end{description}

\subsection{Bytecode compiler}

Change code to compile bytecode:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
	def compiler(self,src):	
	
		# ===== init code section =====
		# set instruction pointer entry point
		self.Ip = 0							
		# clean up program memory
		self.program = []
		
		# ===== parser/compiler code section =====
		def p_program_epsilon(p):
			' program : '
		def p_program_recursive(p):
			' program : program command '
		def p_command_NOP(p):
			' command : NOP '
			self.program.append(self.nop)
		def p_command_BYE(p):
			' command : BYE '
			self.program.append(self.bye)

		# feed &amp; parse source code using lexer
		parser.parse(src,lexer)				
\end{lstlisting}
Now compiler does no add any entry code, and \emph{traced code is our program}.
\begin{lstlisting}
WARNING: Token 'STRING' defined, but not used
WARNING: Token 'EQ' defined, but not used
WARNING: Token 'REGISTER' defined, but not used
0000 &lt;bound method VM.nop of &lt;__main__.VM&gt; [0, .., 7]
0001 &lt;bound method VM.bye of &lt;__main__.VM&gt; [0, .., 7]
\end{lstlisting}
We have some warnings about terminals not used in our grammar, they are linked
with register load command we omitted. Lets add this command grammar. First
recover full sample program:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
if __name__ == '__main__':
	VM(r''' # use r' : we have escapes in string constant
 		R1 = 'R\t[1]'
        nop
        bye
	''')
\end{lstlisting}
Remember we have defined in lexer:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \# comments \ref{lexcomment}
  \item parsing string using special lexer state \ref{lexstring} 
\end{itemize}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=python]
		def p_command_R_load(p):
			' command : REGISTER EQ constant'
			# compile ld command opcode
			self.program.append(self.ld)
			# compile register number using value
			# from terminal REGISTER at p[$1] in production
			self.program.append(p[1])
			# compile constant
			self.program.append(p[3])
		def p_constant_STRING(p):
			' constant : STRING '
			p[0] = p[1]
\end{lstlisting}
We defined \verb|constant| nonterminal for later use: constant can be not
string, but also number, or pointer to any object.
\clearpage
\begin{lstlisting}
0000 &lt;bound method VM.ld&gt; [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
0003 &lt;bound method VM.nop&gt; [0, 'R\t[1]', 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
0004 &lt;bound method VM.bye&gt; [0, 'R\t[1]', 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
\end{lstlisting}

\chapter{Parsing in \cpp: simple calculator}\clearpage

If you don't interested in low-level programming in \cpp, please skip this
chapter. But if you know C++ a bit, look at this theme much closer: flex/bison
is cool tools lets you do lot of things looks very complex on first glance:
\begin{description}
\item[process any data in text format], like config files and data for your
programs, it is very suitable to have this data in human readable form
\item[process complex command line]: pack \verb|argv[]| into one string and
interpret it as script
\item[process source code], you can make syntax colorer writes into .html files,
in few lines, using only flex.
\end{description}

In this chapter, we'll see how to implement simple calculator \textit{with infix
syntax} and variables, works in console. It is a quite useful program,
especially if your job coupled with engineering or science. I myself constantly
use it making some CADding and in occasionally everyday use.

In next sections, we'll see how to add some very complex in fact theme:
\emph{user-defined functions}, some control constructions, and arrays.

\bigskip
You can download full source code from separate github repo:
\url{http://github.com/ponyatov/calc}, and
\href{http://github.com/ponyatov/calc/releases/latest}{prebuild windows
binary} for first try.

\section{skelex: lexical program project skeleton}

First, we'll see how to organize our tiny project.
\bigskip

Nowdays you use huge IDE for software development, but I prefer more light,
portable and easy way: I use (g)vim \ref{vim} text editor and Makefile\note{and
Eclipse for more complex cases}. Vim has strange key bindings, and can be some
cryptic for a newbie, but is very light in resources and have useful syntax
coloring customization described in details in vim syntax coloring
\ref{vimcolor}.

\bigskip
\begin{tabular}{l l l}
src.src &amp; script &amp; sample source code \\
log.log &amp; &amp; execution log \\
ypp.ypp &amp; yacc &amp; syntax parser \\
lpp.lpp &amp; lex &amp; lexer using regexps \\
hpp.hpp &amp; \cpp &amp; headers \\
cpp.cpp &amp; \cpp &amp; runtime system we are going to implement \\
Makefile &amp; make &amp; project build script \\
rc.rc &amp; linux &amp; (g)vim start helper \\
bat.bat &amp; windows &amp; (g)vim start helper \\
.gitignore &amp; git &amp; ignored file masks \\
ftdetect.vim &amp; vim &amp; file type detection \\
syntax.vim &amp; vim &amp; syntax coloring \ref{vimcolor} for custom script \\
\end{tabular}

\clearpage
\begin{lstlisting}[title=rc.rc]
#!/bin/sh
gvim -p src.src log.log \
				ypp.ypp lpp.lpp hpp.hpp cpp.cpp Makefile
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Makefile: build script}

For project build, you need to \emph{track file interdependency} and do some
actions \emph{only on changed files}. So we can describe out dependency/action
rules in tiny Makefile, and run make tool by hotkey in editor every time we need
to compile or run project. Consult Addendum: GNU Make \ref{make} for details,
here we see only tiny Makefile snippet.

\clearpage
\lstinputlisting[title=Makefile,language=make]{../tmp/calc.mk}

\section{lex: lexer generator}

Lexer and parser files use same header with \verb|#include &lt;headers&gt;|:
\begin{lstlisting}[title={lpp.lpp}]

#include "hpp.hpp"

\end{lstlisting}
Lexer file \emph{must end with empty line}, don't forget to place EOL in last
string.
\begin{lstlisting}[title={ypp.ypp}]

#include "hpp.hpp"

\end{lstlisting}

\clearpage
Another \emph{required} section is rules, but for fist time it can be empty:
\begin{lstlisting}[title={lpp.lpp}]

\end{lstlisting}

\noindent
Now you can run flex, and get resulting generated lexer source in lex.yy.c file:
\begin{lstlisting}
$&gt; flex lpp.lpp &amp;&amp; ls -la lex*
-rw-r--r-- 1 ponyatov ponyatov 43935 nov 20 19:43 lex.yy.c
\end{lstlisting}
And we have a problem: there is no \verb|lex.yy.h| header file, contains
\verb|yylex()| and \verb|yy_scan_string()| function declaration we required to
parse every string, entered in interactive command line\note{using readline
library}. To fix it, we must add option will create header file for as.

\section{Binary parsing}

To decode a lot of complex binary formats and protocols you can use binary
parser generator described here. You can describe format using special BNF-like
language, and do syntax triggering technique to do actions on parsed data.
The algorithm used is a special case of DCG \ref{DCG}\ tuned for stream parsing
with error recovery enabled.

For example, you can use this tool to write protocol parsers for widely known
grabbing/decoder software \href{http://www.wireshark.org/}{Wireshark}, 
simple disassemblers, and binary data file dumpers.
