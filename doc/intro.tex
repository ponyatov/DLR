\secly{Intro}

I spent a lot of time asking about some ready library or framework let me easy
transform simple syntax parser written in flex/bison into dynamic language
interpreter. Search still in progress, teraton runtimes like JVM not preferred,
portability and light resource requirements are preferred.

So I'm dreaming about some mix of languages:
\latexhtml{\begin{itemize}[nosep]}{\begin{itemize}}
  \item \emph{Python}ic syntax 
  \item \emph{SmallTalk} live object system\note{able to run on
  Beowulf-like cluster networks thanks to message passing scalability}\ and
  hibernation
  \item \emph{Erlang} parallelism and stability
  \item object/graph database engine embedded, RDBMS connectivity
  \item extremal portability much more then \emph{Java} (Android required)
  \item tiny RAM usage, light and fast run, one executable file installation
\end{itemize}
