\chapter{Cross-compiling Linux for server node}\label{cross}\clearpage

\noindent
If you plan to use dedicated server\note{single, cluster or grid} for private
network, you can use Linux running on x86 PC or set of Raspberry Pi -like boards
mounted in compact chassie. Another way can be more cheap and safe, use virtual
hosting able to run custom minisystem from image, or use own virtualization
server to do some debugging and play with multiple VMs.

You can use any mainstream Linux distro\note{especially on side hostings}, but
in this chapter we'll see how to build some special \term{embedded Linux}
variant able to run on tiny ARM computers, or use full resources on large x86
PC.

Another goal of this chapter to show some technique on \emph{using inference
engine}\ \ref{inference}\ for large and complex \term{configuration
management}. You can define hage amount of configuration parameters and build
options of hardware platform and software packages, \emph{and its dependency},
and inference lets you do parameter coordination.
