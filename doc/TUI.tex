\chapter{TUI: Text User Interface}\label{TUI}\clearpage

As we are going to use DLR for RealTime control systems \ref{RT},
\textit{graphics interfaces are not suitable for us}. Even simple graphics like
text output \emph{require a huge amount of memory} to store window region
images, \emph{and a lot of bus time to transfer} (bitblit) this regions. Typical
PLC or control panel can have tiny text-only LCD with down to short one line and
few joystick-like buttons. No large touchscreen, qwerty keyboard or trackball
devices.
