\section{What is Program?}

Program is something executing in sequence.

\lstinputlisting[language=Python]{py01.py}
\begin{lstlisting}
0000 <function nop at 0x7ff7bb790b18>
0001 <function bye at 0x7ff7bb790c08>
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Wrap in class}

\lstinputlisting[language=Python]{py02.py}
\begin{lstlisting}
0000 <unbound method VM.nop>
0001 <unbound method VM.bye>
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Transfer data between parts of program}

Widely used methods to transfer data between parts of program:
\begin{description}
\item[registers] used on all mainstream computers, thus it is fastes memory
embedded into CPU core. 
We can add registers into \verb|VM| class as static array: it must be shared
between multiple instances on \verb|VM|, represents parallel processes.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
class VM:
    R = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]	# registers shared
    						# between VM instances
\end{lstlisting} 
\item[stack]
\item[memory to memory]
\end{description}
