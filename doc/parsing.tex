\section{Binary parsing}

To decode a lot of complex binary formats and protocols you can use binary
parser generator described here. You can describe format using special BNF-like
language, and do syntax triggering technique to do actions on parsed data.
The algorithm used is a special case of DCG \ref{DCG}\ tuned for stream parsing
with error recovery enabled.

For example, you can use this tool to write protocol parsers for widely known
grabbing/decoder software \href{http://www.wireshark.org/}{Wireshark}, 
simple disassemblers, and binary data file dumpers.
