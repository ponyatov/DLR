\part{Tutorial}\label{newbie}

If you just start to learn about implementing \ref{implementing} programming
languages, and want to write your own script language \ref{whylanguage}, it is
better to start from a simple. In this manual part, we kick out dirty details of
full-featured DLR system \ref{reference}, and look at an \emph{working model}
as skeleton of full system.

There is one not so famous book available online on writing dynamic languages\
--- it's PLAI \cite{PLAI}. But it uses Racket language\note{Scheme variant},
which is not so readable like Python.
