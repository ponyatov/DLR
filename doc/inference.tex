\part{Fuzzy logic inference}

In this section we'll implement Prolog and fuzzy logic inference engine, and
extend our metasystem with ability to do semantic network and hypergraph
inference.

First steps we will be do using well known
\href{http://yieldprolog.sourceforge.net/}{Yield Prolog} (YP), and then
generalize it to \term{predicate functions} and \term{green threads} to do distributed
inference.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
def person():
    yield "Chelsea"
    yield "Hillary"
    yield "Bill"

for p in person(): print p
\end{lstlisting}
Here we define \verb|parson()| \term{generator function} which yeilds few
persons in loop returning \term{iterator object} multiple times.
In place of returning values from iterator, we will use \emph{Prolog variables},
able to be binded/unbinded with values in process of \term{inference}. Return
value from yield does not matter anythng, so we just yield.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
class Pvar: pass    # empty container class

def person(V):
    V.value = 'Chelsea' ; yield
    V.value = 'Hillary' ; yield
    V.value = 'Bill'	; yield

var = Pvar()
for p in person(var): print var.value
\end{lstlisting}
